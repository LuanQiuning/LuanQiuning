It improved one of the whole wheat bread products of “Three Squirrels”. The whole wheat bread was made by rapid fermentation with the combination of lactic acid bacteria starter, yeast and a little α-amylase and xylanase. The improved bread tasted softer, included more nutrients and less additives, and could be reserved for a longer period. This product came third in this competition (top 1.8%).
